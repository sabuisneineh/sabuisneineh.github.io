 <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hi, my name is Sarah. I am 17 years old. My favorite color is grey, and I like cars. I currently work at a clothing store, but hoping that'll change in the next few months. I have one older brother, and two younger brothers. We are from Orland Park, IL. I am majoring in cyber security with a minor in computer science. I chose this because I don't see myself anywhere else. Intro to Computer Science is my favorite class I've taken at Lewis so far. I'm excited to continue taking courses in my major.</p>
    <h3>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
    <p> <ul>
    <li>Learn basic programming</li> 
    <li>Improve problem solving skills</li>
    <li>Make an advanced project by the end of the semester</li>
    </ul> 
<h3>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h3>
<p>I like playing basketball in my free time. I used to play on a team, I was a small forward. I  like to go for walks, and learn new things in a subject I'm interested in. I also consider working as a hobby since I do it a lot, and actually enjoy it. I might consider cleaning as my favorite activity because it makes me feel more put together. </p>
<h3>Fun Fact</h3>
<p>A fun fact about me is that my favorite season is winter. </p>
